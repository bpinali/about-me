        <p>I consider myself fortunate to be a digital native, part of one of the first generations to grow up with ready access to the internet. I've watched in amazement since the time I was a kid as the web has grown and evolved. More than ever, I'm excited to be a bigger part of it.</p>

        <p>I was born and raised in Austin, Texas and that is where I currently reside. I'm one of the few who isn't a transplant. I've been forever spoiled by delicious food and excellent live music at every turn.</p>
